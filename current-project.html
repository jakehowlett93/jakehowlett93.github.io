        <p>Since early december I have been working as part of a three person team to develop a web app, it is essentially chinese whispers but with drawings.
          I have spent most of this time creating modular react components that are controlled using state, this has taught me a lot about how state works within react.
          To hook the components up and get their elements to properly effect state I have been writting functions, all functions that alter state are kept in a seperate module,
          this has allowed me to control the state across multiple components without having to uplift state. <br>
          For each function I have been writting unit-tests, for this project we decided to use jest for unit-testing. As this has been my first time writting unit-tests I have 
          found it enlightening and now know a lot more about how unit-tests are written and what they are testing for. I have also been working with flow for static type checking. <br>
          For version control we have been using GIT, I have never used it in a team before and this has given me the oppertunity to learn about branches, pull requests and conflict resolution. 
          I have also been reviewing my collegues pull requests which has given me lots of practice at reading and understanding other peoples code. <br>
          For the back-end we have been using socket.io, whilst I havent been involved a whole lot in the back-end i did implement server side validation that ensured only the admin was able to start
          the game, so I have some experience with node.js and web sockets. <br>
          Throughout this project I have been responsible for deciding when i need to use external libraries, researching relevant libraries and then installing them using NPM. <br>
          To manage the project we have been taking an agile approach and using a card system on the website trello to keep track of what needs to be done and whos working on what. <br>
          In the near future ill be using CSS grid to create the layout for the components, I also need to determine a way to automatically create interesting phrases from three lists of words.
