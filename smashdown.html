            This smashdown webpage is the first one I have made for a client. This client plays a game called Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, which has a game mode called smashdown that is only 
            available for local games. The client wanted a webpage that allowed them to track the things necessary to play the smashdown mode online with friends. I started by getting a 
            solid understanding of what the client wanted via user stories. I then built a bare bones page that had the core features available, this let the client try out the site and refine 
            or add further user stories. I worked through the remaining user stories to finish the site and polish it off, after a few tweaks the client was very happy with the webpage.<br>
            <br>
            For this webpage I decided to add to my skill set by using jquery. I really liked the ease of selecting DOM elements and the improved readability of code. The feature
            that I found most useful was the built in iterator which made for much cleaner code.<br>
            This project also gave me the opportunity to set up NPM, Webpack, Jest, Babel, Prettier and ESLint on my own for the first time. I now have a better understanding of how to 
            install and manage libraries aswell as how to set up my package.json scripts. <br>
            I got some good practice in with CSS too and i feel like it comes to me a lot easier now, I'm quicker at identifying what html I need to target and I'm confident using flex to style. 
            I took advantage of the chrome dev tool that allows CSS to be edited in the browser which made debugging a lot faster.
            Similarly to CSS I now find testing with Jest easier as I gained a better understanding of how it works and I learned how to layout test suites in a way that keeps them readable even 
            as they get more complex. <br>
