            <h2>Personal Statement</h2>
          </header>
          <pre>
I am a highly motivated Business and Finance graduate achieving a first class degree. Looking for a job specializing in programming. I chose Business & Finance to strengthen my knowledge of how the financial world operates. Programming has always been an interest of mine and I have been teaching it to myself in my spare time. The following courses have been completed to further a career in software development.
    
Udemy: Complete Python bootcamp 
freecodecamp.org:	JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification
freecodecamp.org: Responsive Web Design Certification
              
I have worked on personal projects including creating the games breakout, blackjack and space invaders from scratch to practice using an object orientated approach. I have also built several web pages to practice my HTML and CSS skills. I’m currently in the process of creating a portfolio site using the bootstrap framework, whilst working on my JavaScript skills. All of which can be found on my GitHub profile.
