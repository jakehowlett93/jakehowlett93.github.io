          <p>I decided to make three games to test my skills after completing the Complete Python Bootcamp course on Udemy, theses games were Pong, 
            Breakout, and Space Invaders. The goal was to write reusable code so that each game could be made by 
          building on the code from the previous game. It was my first time using Pygame as well which gave me 
          the opportunity to learn how to use a library by reading its documentation. I started by making pong
          as it is the simplest of the three games, the code was made reusable by using classes and self contained
          functions. I then moved on to breakout which used the same classes as pong, with several extra functions 
          added and a very similar game loop. Space invaders was much the same using the same classes and functions 
          with a few new ones added. My favourite part of this project was being able to launch the games and see 
          a visual representation of what the changes I was making to my code were doing, which really helped boost my 
          understanding.<a href="https://github.com/jakehowlett93/pygame_games">Click here to see the repository.</a></p>
